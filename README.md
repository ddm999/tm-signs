# tm-signs
Custom signs for TrackMania (2020).

Most if not all are probably based on TrackMania Turbo & Marie's Modern Pack signs (https://mariejuku.github.io/skinchooser.html), to fill gaps for signs I wanted.



ok i don't seem to get how to do it exactly, these don't load in correctly for me? the URL is accepted but it just shows the default nadeo image ðŸ˜¢

if someone knows what i'm doing wrong and is here for some reason, raise an issue i guess lmao
